floyd-warshall algorithm implementation in Haskell, with tests in python and C (graph generator + naive implementation)

Prequisites:

sudo apt-get install ghc
sudo apt-get install cabal-install
cabal update
cabal install parallel

Usage:

see doop.py and doop2.py for usage examples (these are simple tests).

Notes:

Different type of array should be used, no time to fix that.

Based on:

A scalable parallelization of all-pairs shortest path algorithm for a high performance cluster environment
